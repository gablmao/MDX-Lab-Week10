WEEK 9 - SOFTWARE TESTING WOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAH

> to test means to validate whether the software meets its requirements
or not
    > if not met, see where and how the software doesn't meet the 
    requirements

> defect testing is trying to discover how the software can bug out/behave
incorrectly

> to debug means to find the errors in the code causing the software to
fail and correct the code

> activity 1:
    > the tester (it's in the name) should test the program...
    > ... as soon as possible, when the new code is deployed/commited



> DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT TESTING:
> UNIT TESTING
    > testing units, such as methods, functions and objects
    > testing using frameworks, such as Catch and JUnit

> COMPONENT TESTING
    > testing components that interact with the software
        > for example, returns behavioura/data throughout the software

> SYSTEM TESTING
    > combination, of previous two testings, it essentially tests the
    whole program, or sometimes parts of the program
    > the most time-consuming version of testing

> RELEASE TESTING
    > tests whether the final version of a software is ready to be released
        > this means meeting requirements

> USER TESTING
    > where the target user gets to use the software you made for
        > recieve feedback, create various versions of the software
        and test again

> AUTOMATED TESTING
    > automate parts of the program
        > repeat runs and checking the inputs/outputs, checking if the
        results is correct/to be expected
